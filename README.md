# My very own programming language, I give you: Occam's tongue

## About
This is a custom programming language, made for a secondary project of mine I am working on at the same. Why did I make this? well I needed a tool for the project I mentioned and I was bored. I also didn't know what to do while learning Rust.
So I decided to make a programming language, this was originally destined to be a Python project but I decided it would be more fun like so.

## What is it based off 
Occam's Tongue (OT) is a verbose, systems-oriented esoteric language that maps natural-language manifestations directly to LLVM-optimized machine code.

## How to run it
After making a pull of this repo, simply create a .ot file at the root of the folder or use the ritual.ot file that is premade, then after making your program and saving, run the manifest.sh. Also don't forget to do a cargo build after pulling to 
load all the crates.

## I will provide documentation on how to use this language in a seperate file in the repo

## Special thanks
I would like to give a special thanks to [devilishlyney](https://github.com/devilishlyney) for emotional support.

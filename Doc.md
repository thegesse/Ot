# This is temporary as OT will change syntax as I please

## General Rules
- End of statements:
  - Every action must be ended with "As_It_has_Been_written"
- Casing:
  - Keywords are in Pascal_case. Varaiable names are case sensitive
- Comments:
  - All text preceded by "--" is ignored

## Syntax
- Semicolons
  Since we dont use symbols the semicolons are replaced with "As_It_has_Been_written"

- Brackets and Braces
    - Both of these are replaced with "Withing_This_Realm_Begin" for opening and closing with "By_Its_Edict_Conclude"

- Parantheses
    - these are replaced with "Consider_The_Following" and "Considerations_Concluded"

- Commas
    - OT uses whitespaces as seperators but commas are still available for function arguments and are under the keyword "In_Addition_To_The_Aformentioned"

- Colon
    - The colon keyword is "Under_The_category_Of"

## Variables
To store data in the stack you must use a manifestation statement like so:
- For integers: 
  - The_Quantity_Of_Whole_Existance (name) Shall_HenceForth_Be_Seen_as (value) As_It_has_Been_written
- For Floats: 
  - A_Mere_Approximation_Of_Reality (name) Shall_HenceForth_Be_Seen_as (value) As_It_has_Been_written
 
## Outputs
To get a message or a value in the terminal you must request the knowledge like so:
Request_The_Universe_Manifest_The_Knowledge_Of (expression)

## Arithmetics
The language supports basic opperations such as
- Additions: Augmented_By_The_Value_Of
- Subtractions: Diminished_By_The_Value_Of
- Multiplications: Replicated_In_Multitudes_Of
- Divisions: Distributed_In_Partitions_Of

## Loops
There are also the **while** and **for** loops included
- While loops
    - Whilst_The_Truth_Remains (expression)
    - Within_This_Realm_Begin
      - (body statement)
    - By_Its_Edict_Conclude
    
- For loops
    - Initiate_The_Recursive_Protocol_Under_The_Guise_Of
        - (initialization statement)
    - While_The_Observation_Holds_True

    - Until_The_Incremental_Shift_Reaches
        - (step statement)
    - Within_This_Realm_Begin
        - (body statement)
    - By_Its_Edict_Conclude

## Conditions
